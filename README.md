It is inspired by the code style of [Laravel's Forge SDK](https://github.com/themsaid/forge-sdk).

## Installation

This package can be installed through Composer:

```sh
$ composer require bytestgear/activecampaign
```

Make sure to use Composer's autoload:

```php
require __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';
```

Start by creating a new instance:

```php
$activeCampaign = new ActiveCampaign(ACTIVE_CAMPAIGN_URL, ACTIVE_CAMPAIGN_KEY);
``` 

Your API key can be found in your account on the Settings page under the "Developer" tab.

## Usage

Once instantiated, you can simply call one of the methods provided by the SDK:

```php
$activeCampaign->contacts();
```

This will provide you with a list of available contacts.

To create a contact, you can use the `createContact` method:

```php
$contact = $activeCampaign->createContact([
    'email' => 'johndoe@example.com',
    'firstName' => 'John',
    'lastName' => 'Doe',
]);
```

When the request was successful, `$contact` will contain a Contact object with the contact details.

## Tests

The package contains integration tests. You can run them using PHPUnit.

```
$ vendor/bin/phpunit
```
